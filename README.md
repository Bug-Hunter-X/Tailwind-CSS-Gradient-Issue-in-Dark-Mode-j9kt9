# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue in Dark Mode

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to gradient backgrounds in Tailwind CSS when dark mode is enabled.

## Problem Description

The gradient appears distorted or behaves unexpectedly in dark mode, deviating from its intended appearance in light mode. This issue may arise from interactions with other CSS rules or browser-specific rendering differences.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run a local development server (e.g., using Vite or Webpack).
3.  Observe the gradient's appearance in both light and dark modes.
4.  Notice the discrepancy in how the gradient renders.

## Solution

The solution provided addresses the gradient distortion by introducing a more explicit configuration. This ensures the gradient renders correctly regardless of the browser or dark mode settings.
